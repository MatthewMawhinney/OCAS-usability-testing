## Tester Feedback/Pain Points

### Tester 1:

#### Task #10: 
> Very odd some of the options -> entry “level 1” for example, why would it be anything else?
> Unsure of what this means after reading the comment area
> Wish there was a button to take you to the college site. Selecting it solely on when it starts and what the program is called 
> Hit cancel and it took tester out of application – confusing 
> Basis of admission question is confusing

#### Task #12:
> No box to click after the text says “check the box and save” -> just pressed “save” and it took him back to the outside of the application, had to resume application again
>Unusable – could not add transcript

#### Task #13:
> Pressed complete order but seemed unclear what to press
> Liked that you could scan a credit card with photo option

---

### Tester 2: 

#### Task #4:
> The auto address fill is annoying, faster to type in yourself.

#### Task #6:
> Options in the scroll menu are cut off from the screen (unless rotated horizontally).

#### Task #7:
> Did not attend high school in Canada so was a bit difficult to navigate to international education.

#### Task #10:
